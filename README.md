## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Auti
Also known as [AutiOne](https://auti.one) through my funky brand. I code and design stuff on my computer since my early nerdy days, and hope to make something useful eventually. You can use any pronouns with me, but I do prefer they/them! :)

You can reach out to me through the links below:
